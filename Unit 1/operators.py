# Data manipulation  - Operators

# In python we have operators, that
# allow us to change data.

# Assignment operators
# assignment operators use some combination of the equal
# Comparison operators

name = 'Kailin' # the equal sign is the opeator
willItSnow = True
numberOfSandwiches = 10
bankaccount = 100000

# Comparison operators
# comparisons operators allow us to evaluate data
#based on several facotors

10 < 20 # is 10 less than 20

20.34 >= 0 # is 20.34 greater than or equal to 0

100 == 100 # is 100 the SAME AS 100

100 != 10 # is 100 not the SAME AS 10

# Arithmatic operators
# the arithmatic operators allow us to perform
# math with- specifically with the intereger and float
# data types

10 + 10 # addition
12 - 2 # subtraction

# Logical operators
# we use logical operators to evalute if data is true
# or false

password = '123'
securityQuestion = 'Sample'

mathAnswer = 4
# and - used to compare to conditions that are both true

# if both conditions below are true, we will have the value
# of true

password == '123' and 4 == mathAnswer

# or - used to copare conditions, But only one needs to
# to be true in order for the output to be true

password = '123' or 2+3 == mathAnswer

# not - used to compare conditions. BUT will
# output the opposite result- meaning if two things are true
# we are going to get false

# whatever the real result is, will become the opposite
not(password == '123' and 2+2 ==mathAnswer)
